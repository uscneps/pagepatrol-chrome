# pagepatrol-chrome ðŸ§­ (Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge)
Page Patrol aims to gently introduce the reader to the article by offering a clear summary of key points, suggesting related topics, and providing other relevant insights.

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Page Patrol is to create a tool that helps readers engage with content more thoughtfully and efficiently. With the rise of information overload, i wanted a way to provide readers with a summarized version of an article's key points, relevant topics, and useful insights, making it easier for them to get a meaningful understanding quickly.

## What it does
-  A concise summary of the main points.
- Suggestions for related topics to encourage further exploration.
- Relevant details, like content dates, to help readers assess the context and currency of the information.

## How we built it
I used Prompt & Summary API, after joined the preview program i start to build a chrome extensions (this is my first one) using React. is really scalable from a feature point of view so the idea is to build more also after the hackaton.

## Challenges we ran into
Currently im struggling with articles that include many images or code. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
i'm proud of creating a tool that can enhance reading engagement, especially for users who are short on time. The AI-driven summaries and topic suggestions add a personalized touch to content consumption, making complex information accessible. Successfully implementing a seamless, user-friendly design that feels intuitive was also a big accomplishment.

## What we learned
i learned about the importance of refining AI model outputs to achieve human-like quality in summaries. Additionally, we gained experience in optimizing UI/UX for dynamic content and became more adept at state management to handle asynchronous AI processing without impacting the user experience.

## What's next for Page Patrol
- Adding multi-language support to make the tool accessible globally.
- Implementing advanced customization options for summaries, so users can adjust the summary length and style.
- Integrating sentiment analysis and tone indicators to give readers additional context about the content's tone.
- Enhancing related topic suggestions with deeper topic clustering for more nuanced recommendations

# how run it ? 
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run build```
